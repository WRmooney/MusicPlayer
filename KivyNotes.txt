Notes about how to use Kivy

Kivy itself:

Main.py has the main app entry point, aka the base widget?
widgets are things that are parts


in kv files:

<NameThingIdk>: This defines the rules that apply to all NameThingIdk instances
^^^ that is a widget rule
kv files use indentation to define nested blocks
rule sections allow to define the style and contents
can set property values, add child widgets, add graphics instructions, etc.

canvas sections defines some basic graphics for the entire widget
Labels are basically text
